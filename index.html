<h1 id="nerd-small-talk">Nerd Small Talk</h1>
<p>Nerd Small Talk (NST) is a collection of short articles that give a brief
overview of interesting subjects.  They are aimed at the &quot;intelligent
layperson,&quot; the definition of which I&#39;ve never understood but seems to mean
&quot;similar to the author before they knew the subject.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-topics-does-nst-cover-">What kind of topics does NST cover?</h2>
<p>Topics in science, history, or similar subjects that I think the well-educated
person should have at least a passing familiarity with, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early human evolution</li>
<li>The Bronze Age</li>
<li>DNA translation and transcription</li>
<li>Basic climate science</li>
<li>Timeline of the evolution of life</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>
<p>While I think people should be passingly familiar with these subjects, the
dirty secret is that I had to learn them through countless books, online
courses, Wikipedia articles, etc.  To help me digest and remember them, I&#39;ve
written these summary articles.  This means you might be able to skip all of
the work and read these articles instead.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-cover-the-topics-">How does it cover the topics?</h2>
<p>The articles try to cover the topics at the level described by a wonderful
professor of mine as &quot;Cocktail Party Bullshit Knowledge.&quot;  The goal is that
after reading an article, you will be able to spin a fascinating and
informative tale to someone who knows nothing about the subject, and ask
intelligent questions of a specialist.  You will certainly not have an in-depth
understanding; at least not from these articles.  But it should be a good
starting point to explore further, if you are so intrigued.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-are-the-articles-">How long are the articles?</h2>
<p>Lengths vary, but we try to keep them to a few hundred 80-character lines.
They should take somewhere from 15 minutes to an hour to read, but longer if
you want to look up extra material and dive into Wikipedia.</p>
<h2 id="are-these-articles-original-scholarship-">Are these articles original scholarship?</h2>
<p>No!  They are cobbled together from other sources.  In fact, they are not
scholarship of any kind.  I have been liberal with my simplifications and
reckless with rounding, with the hope that it will be easier to remember.  I&#39;d
rather you remember the Cambrian Explosion occured half a billion years ago,
than forget that it occured 542 million years ago.  I have attempted to keep
things simple by rarely mentioning alternatives to the dominant scholarly
consensus, and I expect any specialist to read these articles to shake their
head in sadness.  That probably also holds true for the non-specialist who&#39;s
read a introductory book on the subject.  Which I whole-heartedly recommend you
do after reading the article; it&#39;ll just take you longer.</p>
<h2 id="what-order-should-i-read-them-in-">What order should I read them in?</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve tried to keep them self-contained, but for those that require an
additional article I&#39;ve tried to note that in the beginning.  Many articles
relate to each other, so it might be that re-reading an article after reading
related ones will cast a new light on the original.</p>
