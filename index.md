Nerd Small Talk
===============

Nerd Small Talk (NST) is a collection of short articles that give a brief
overview of interesting subjects.  They are aimed at the "intelligent
layperson," the definition of which I've never understood but seems to mean
"similar to the author before they knew the subject."

What kind of topics does NST cover?
-----------------------------------
Topics in science, history, or similar subjects that I think the well-educated
person should have at least a passing familiarity with, including:

* Early human evolution
* The Bronze Age
* DNA translation and transcription
* Basic climate science
* Timeline of the evolution of life
* and more...

While I think people should be passingly familiar with these subjects, the
dirty secret is that I had to learn them through countless books, online
courses, Wikipedia articles, etc.  To help me digest and remember them, I've
written these summary articles.  This means you might be able to skip all of
the work and read these articles instead.

How does it cover the topics?
-----------------------------
The articles try to cover the topics at the level described by a wonderful
professor of mine as "Cocktail Party Bullshit Knowledge."  The goal is that
after reading an article, you will be able to spin a fascinating and
informative tale to someone who knows nothing about the subject, and ask
intelligent questions of a specialist.  You will certainly not have an in-depth
understanding; at least not from these articles.  But it should be a good
starting point to explore further, if you are so intrigued.

How long are the articles?
--------------------------
Lengths vary, but we try to keep them to a few hundred 80-character lines.
They should take somewhere from 15 minutes to an hour to read, but longer if
you want to look up extra material and dive into Wikipedia.

Are these articles original scholarship?
----------------------------------------
No!  They are cobbled together from other sources.  In fact, they are not
scholarship of any kind.  I have been liberal with my simplifications and
reckless with rounding, with the hope that it will be easier to remember.  I'd
rather you remember the Cambrian Explosion occured half a billion years ago,
than forget that it occured 542 million years ago.  I have attempted to keep
things simple by rarely mentioning alternatives to the dominant scholarly
consensus, and I expect any specialist to read these articles to shake their
head in sadness.  That probably also holds true for the non-specialist who's
read a introductory book on the subject.  Which I whole-heartedly recommend you
do after reading the article; it'll just take you longer.


What order should I read them in?
---------------------------------
I've tried to keep them self-contained, but for those that require an
additional article I've tried to note that in the beginning.  Many articles
relate to each other, so it might be that re-reading an article after reading
related ones will cast a new light on the original.
